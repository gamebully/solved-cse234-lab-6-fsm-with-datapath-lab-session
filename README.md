<strong>FSM with Datapath Lab Session </strong>

<strong>(Exact Duration: 90min): </strong>

C code:

<strong>while(goi==0); x = xi; y = yi; z = 1; diff = x – y; diff2 = diff; while(diff &gt; 0){      z = z * diff2;  diff = diff – 1;} </strong>




<ol>

 <li>First draw ASM.</li>

 <li>Design datapath on Logisim and update ASM accordingly.</li>

 <li>Design your FSM controller using Logisim and combine datapath and controller in Logisim.</li>

 <li>Simulate your resultant circuit to be sure it works flawless.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Rules: </strong>

DO NOT USE ANALYZE CIRCUIT PROPERTY OF LOGISIM. You can use multiplier subtractor or adder in Logisim. Using less components makes a better score. X, y, z, diff and diff2 are registers in datapath. Assume 8 bit numbers.

<strong>Demo Session: </strong>

During demo, explain and simulate each step of your design. Do not forget you only have at most 4 minutes for that. Also you will answer any questions asked by the TA.
